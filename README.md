Project: GrubDash

You've been hired as a back-end developer for a new startup called GrubDash! As another developer works on the design and front-end experience, you have been tasked with setting up an API and building out specific routes so that the front-end developers demo out some initial design ideas to the big bosses.

This project will test your ability to build API's with complex validation. To succeed at this project, you'll need to demonstrate that you can do the following:

    Run tests from the command line.
    Use common middleware packages.
    Receive requests through routes.
    Access relevant information through route parameters.
    Build an API following RESTful design principles.
    Write custom middleware functions.

You will not need to make any edits to HTML or CSS for this project.
